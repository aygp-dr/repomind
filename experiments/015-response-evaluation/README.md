# Experiment 015: Response Evaluation

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive evaluation framework to measure and improve the quality of RepoMind's responses, ensuring accuracy, relevance, and usefulness.

## Goals
- Create objective quality metrics for responses
- Build evaluation datasets with ground truth
- Implement automated quality scoring
- Enable A/B testing of improvements
- Generate quality improvement insights

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Quality scores computed consistently
- [ ] Evaluation dataset covers key scenarios
- [ ] A/B testing framework operational
- [ ] Quality trends tracked over time
- [ ] Actionable improvement recommendations

## Dependencies
- Experiment 014: Telemetry foundation (provides metrics infrastructure)

## Files
- `eval-framework.scm` - Core evaluation infrastructure
- `quality-metrics.scm` - Response quality scoring algorithms
- `benchmark-suite.scm` - Standard test queries and expected results
- `ab-testing.scm` - Compare different approaches

## Running the Experiment
```bash
make test MIN_QUALITY_SCORE=0.8
```

## Quality Dimensions

- All requested information provided
- Sufficient detail level
- Context included
- Examples when helpful

### Relevance (20% weight)
- Directly answers the question
- Stays on topic
- Appropriate scope
- No unnecessary information

### Coherence (10% weight)
- Logical structure
- Clear progression
- Consistent terminology
- Well-formatted output

### Performance (5% weight)
- Response latency

## Scoring Example
```scheme
(define (score-response query expected actual)
  (let* ((accuracy (score-accuracy expected actual))
         (completeness (score-completeness expected actual))
         (relevance (score-relevance query actual))
         (coherence (score-coherence actual))
         (performance (score-performance telemetry)))
    (weighted-average
      (list (cons 0.40 accuracy)
            (cons 0.25 completeness)
            (cons 0.20 relevance)
            (cons 0.10 coherence)
            (cons 0.05 performance)))))
```

## A/B Testing Framework
1. Define experiment variants
2. Route queries to different pipelines
3. Collect quality metrics for each
4. Statistical significance testing
5. Recommend winning approach

## Quality Reports
- Daily quality trends
- Dimension breakdowns
- Failure analysis
- Improvement opportunities
- Model comparison
