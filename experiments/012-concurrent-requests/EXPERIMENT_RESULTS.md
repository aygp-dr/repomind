# Experiment 012: Concurrent Requests Results

## Summary
Demonstrated concurrent request concepts using work queues, rate limiting, and error isolation without requiring actual threads for the proof of concept.

## Key Learnings
- Guile threading support varies by installation
- Can simulate concurrency concepts effectively for demonstration
- Rate limiting and error isolation principles transfer to real implementations
- Work queue pattern provides foundation for concurrent processing

## Next Steps
- Real implementation would use actual threads or async processing
- Integrate with experiments 009-011 for complete pipeline
