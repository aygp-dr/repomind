# Experiment 092: Development Visualization

## Overview
Create interactive visualizations to better understand and communicate the development approach and concept relationships in RepoMind.

## Goals
- Map experiment relationships and dependencies
- Visualize development methodology flow
- Create interactive concept exploration tools
- Generate documentation diagrams

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Interactive dependency graph showing experiment relationships
- [ ] Concept mapping visualization with color-coded categories
- [ ] Development flow diagrams for different perspectives
- [ ] Web interface for exploring relationships
- [ ] Static diagrams for documentation integration

## Visualization Types

### Dependency Graph
- Show how experiments build on each other
- Highlight critical path dependencies
- Color-code by development phase
- Interactive filtering and zoom

### Concept Map
- Relationship between core concepts (specs, validation, testing, etc.)
- Technology stack interconnections
- Development methodology relationships
- Interactive exploration with details on hover

### Development Flow
- Timeline view of development phases
- Parallel development tracks
- Risk and dependency visualization
- Resource allocation mapping

## Files
- `concept-mapper.scm` - Core concept relationship analysis
- `flow-visualizer.scm` - Development flow diagram generation
- `dependency-analyzer.scm` - Experiment dependency analysis
- `web-interface/` - Interactive web visualization
- `static-diagrams/` - Generated documentation diagrams

## Running the Experiment
```bash
make test           # Generate all visualizations
make serve          # Start interactive web server
```

## Dependencies
- Guile Scheme for analysis
- GraphViz for static diagrams
- D3.js for interactive visualizations
- Web server for serving interactive content

## Implementation Notes
- All experiments include Makefiles that list their dependencies
- The `validate-deps` target in each Makefile shows which experiments must pass first
- This dependency information will be parsed to generate visualizations
- Audit scripts will ensure all experiments have proper Makefile structure

## Results
Status: ðŸŸ¡ Future Work - Not currently needed but planned for later development phases

This experiment will be valuable for:
- Onboarding new developers
- Communicating development approach to stakeholders
- Identifying optimization opportunities in the development flow
- Planning resource allocation across experiment phases
