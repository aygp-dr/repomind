üè∑Ô∏è  Organization-Wide Label Recommendations for aygp-dr
====================================================

Based on comprehensive analysis of all public repositories

## Recommended Standardized Label System

### Core Labels (Use Everywhere)
These should be consistent across all repos:

**Type Labels** (mutually exclusive)
- bug                 #d73a4a  Something isn't working
- enhancement         #a2eeef  New feature or request
- documentation       #0075ca  Documentation improvements
- question            #d876e3  Further information requested
- refactor           #D4C5F9  Code improvement without feature change

**Status Labels** (current state)
- help-wanted         #008672  Extra attention needed
- good-first-issue    #7057ff  Good for newcomers
- blocked             #e4e669  Blocked by external factors
- in-progress         #f0f0f0  Work actively being done
- needs-review        #fbca04  Needs review before merge

**Priority Labels** (optional but recommended)
- priority:critical   #b60205  Must be addressed immediately
- priority:high       #d93f0b  Important, address soon
- priority:medium     #fbca04  Normal priority
- priority:low        #0e8a16  Nice to have

### Project-Specific Label Prefixes
Use these patterns for project-specific needs:

**Component Labels** (component:*)
- component:api       #d4c5f9  API-related
- component:cli       #c5def5  CLI-related
- component:core      #1d76db  Core functionality
- component:ui        #fef2c0  User interface
- component:docs      #0052cc  Documentation system

**Area Labels** (area:*)
- area:security       #d73a4a  Security-related
- area:performance    #fef2c0  Performance-related
- area:testing        #bfd4f2  Testing-related
- area:deployment     #c2e0c6  Deployment/infrastructure

**Type Labels for Advanced Projects** (type:*)
- type:experiment     #7057ff  Experimental work
- type:research       #f9d0c4  Research/investigation
- type:breaking       #d73a4a  Breaking change

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with Core Labels on all repos
2. Add project-specific prefixed labels as needed
3. Use consistent colors for similar concepts
4. Avoid duplicate concepts (e.g., both 'bug' and 'type:bug')

## Migration Path
1. Audit existing labels with analyze-all-labels.sh
2. Create standardized labels on new repos
3. Gradually migrate existing repos
4. Document in organization README

## Benefits of This System
- Consistency across organization
- Easy to understand for new contributors
- Supports both simple and complex projects
- Compatible with GitHub's defaults
- Enables cross-repo issue tracking
