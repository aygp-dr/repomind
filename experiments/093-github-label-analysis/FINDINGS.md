# GitHub Label Analysis Findings

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 75 public repositories in the aygp-dr organization reveals:

- **100% use default GitHub labels** (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)
- **41% have custom labels** beyond the defaults (31 repos)
- **202 unique labels** exist across the organization
- **Structured prefixes** are emerging organically (priority:*, status:*, type:*)

## Key Findings

### 1. Default Labels Are Universal
Every single public repository has the 9 default GitHub labels:
- bug, enhancement, documentation, question
- duplicate, help wanted, good first issue
- invalid, wontfix

### 2. Custom Label Adoption
- 31 repositories (41%) have added custom labels
- Most common additions: performance, testing, priority labels
- Some repos have developed sophisticated labeling systems

### 3. Emerging Patterns

**Priority Labels** (found in 8-9 repos):
- priority:critical
- priority:high
- priority:medium
- priority:low

**Status Labels** (found in 6 repos):
- status:blocked
- status:in-progress
- status:needs-review
- status:ready
- status:wont-fix

**Component/Type Labels** (sporadic):
- component:api, component:cli, component:core
- type:feature, type:security, type:test

## Recommendations for Organization-Wide System

### Minimum Viable Label Set
Keep the GitHub defaults and add:
1. Priority labels (priority:critical/high/medium/low)
2. Status labels for workflow (blocked, in-progress, needs-review)
3. Component labels as needed per project

### Benefits of Standardization
- **Cross-repo visibility**: Track issues across projects
- **Onboarding**: New contributors understand labels immediately
- **Automation**: Consistent labels enable automation
- **Reporting**: Generate org-wide metrics

### Implementation Strategy
1. Start with new repos using the standard set
2. Gradually migrate high-activity repos
3. Document in organization README
4. Create tooling for label management

## Tools Created
- `analyze-all-labels.sh` - Comprehensive label analysis
- `recommend-org-labels.sh` - Standardization recommendations
- `create-project-labels.sh` - Apply labels to repos

## Next Steps
1. Review recommendations with team
2. Create organization label guide
3. Build automation for label application
4. Monitor adoption and iterate
