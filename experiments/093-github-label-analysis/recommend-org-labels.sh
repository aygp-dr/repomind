echo "### Core Labels (Use Everywhere)"
echo "These should be consistent across all repos:"
echo ""
echo "**Type Labels** (mutually exclusive)"

echo "- enhancement         #a2eeef  New feature or request"
echo "- documentation       #0075ca  Documentation improvements"
echo "- question            #d876e3  Further information requested"
echo "- refactor           #D4C5F9  Code improvement without feature change"
echo ""

echo "**Status Labels** (current state)"
echo "- help-wanted         #008672  Extra attention needed"
echo "- good-first-issue    #7057ff  Good for newcomers"
echo "- blocked             #e4e669  Blocked by external factors"
echo "- in-progress         #f0f0f0  Work actively being done"

echo "**Priority Labels** (optional but recommended)"
echo "- priority:critical   #b60205  Must be addressed immediately"
echo "- priority:high       #d93f0b  Important, address soon"
echo "- priority:medium     #fbca04  Normal priority"
echo "- priority:low        #0e8a16  Nice to have"
echo ""

echo "### Project-Specific Label Prefixes"
echo "Use these patterns for project-specific needs:"
echo ""
echo "**Component Labels** (component:*)"
echo "- component:api       #d4c5f9  API-related"
echo "- component:cli       #c5def5  CLI-related"
echo "- component:core      #1d76db  Core functionality"

echo "- type:research       #f9d0c4  Research/investigation"
echo "- type:breaking       #d73a4a  Breaking change"

echo "## Implementation Strategy"
echo "1. Start with Core Labels on all repos"
echo "2. Add project-specific prefixed labels as needed"
echo "3. Use consistent colors for similar concepts"
echo "4. Avoid duplicate concepts (e.g., both 'bug' and 'type:bug')"
echo ""

echo "## Migration Path"
echo "1. Audit existing labels with analyze-all-labels.sh"
echo "2. Create standardized labels on new repos"
echo "3. Gradually migrate existing repos"
echo "4. Document in organization README"
echo ""

echo "## Benefits of This System"
echo "- Consistency across organization"
echo "- Easy to understand for new contributors"
echo "- Supports both simple and complex projects"
echo "- Compatible with GitHub's defaults"
echo "- Enables cross-repo issue tracking"
