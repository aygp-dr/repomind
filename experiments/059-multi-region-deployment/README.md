# Experiment 59: Multi-Region Deployment

## Overview
Implement global deployment strategy with multi-region support for low latency and high availability.

## Goals
- Design multi-region architecture
- Implement data replication strategies
- Configure geographic traffic routing
- Deploy edge computing capabilities
- Ensure compliance with regional data laws

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Deploy to 3+ regions successfully
- [ ] Cross-region latency < 100ms
- [ ] Automatic failover works within 30s
- [ ] Data consistency maintained
- [ ] GDPR/regional compliance verified

## Key Components

### Region Configuration
```yaml
# us-east.yml
region:
  name: us-east-1
  primary: true
  services:
    api: https://api-us-east.repomind.io
    storage: s3://repomind-us-east
  capacity:
    min_instances: 10
    max_instances: 100
  features:
    - full-api
    - websockets
    - batch-processing
```

### Data Replication Strategy
```scheme
(define-replication-strategy
  '((mode . eventual-consistency)
    (lag-target . 5000)  ; 5 seconds
    (conflict-resolution . last-write-wins)
    (priority-regions . (us-east eu-west))))
```

### Traffic Routing
- **GeoDNS**: Route users to nearest region
- **Latency-based**: Dynamic routing based on real-time latency
- **Failover**: Automatic region failover with health checks

### Edge Deployment
- Cloudflare Workers for edge computing
- CDN for static assets and API caching
- Edge-based authentication and rate limiting

## Testing Strategy
- Multi-region load testing
- Failover simulation
- Data consistency verification
- Compliance auditing

## Running the Experiment
```bash
make deploy-multi-region
make test-failover
make verify-replication
make audit-compliance
```

## Dependencies
- Experiments 28-29 (LocalStack for testing)
- Experiments 35 (Docker packaging)
- Experiments 40 (Monitoring)
