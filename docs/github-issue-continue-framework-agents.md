# Port CONTINUE Framework to Use Claude Code Agents

## Summary

Migrate the CONTINUE framework to leverage Claude Code's new agent capabilities for improved modularity and task delegation.

## Background

Claude Code now supports custom agents (subagents) that can be defined in `.claude/agents/` directory. These agents provide:
- Specialized task handling
- Stateless execution model
- Tool orchestration capabilities
- Custom prompts and behaviors

The CONTINUE framework could benefit from this architecture by:
1. Breaking down complex tasks into agent-specific operations
2. Improving code organization and maintainability
3. Enabling parallel task execution
4. Providing clearer separation of concerns

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Create Specialized Agents

Create custom agents for CONTINUE framework operations:

```
.claude/agents/
├── continue-analyzer.md      # Code analysis and understanding
├── continue-refactorer.md    # Code refactoring operations
├── continue-tester.md        # Test generation and execution
├── continue-documenter.md    # Documentation generation
└── continue-reviewer.md      # Code review and suggestions
```

### 2. Agent Definition Structure

Each agent would follow the standard format:
```yaml
---
name: continue-analyzer
description: Analyzes code structure and provides insights for the CONTINUE framework
color: blue
---

[Specific prompts and instructions for code analysis]
```

### 3. Integration Points

- Modify CONTINUE's task dispatcher to use Claude Code's Task tool
- Implement agent selection logic based on operation type
- Add progress tracking across agent invocations
- Ensure proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 4. Benefits

- **Modularity**: Each agent handles specific aspects of the framework
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new capabilities via new agents
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Potential for parallel agent execution

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Research and design
   - Study current CONTINUE architecture
   - Design agent breakdown strategy
   - Create agent interface specifications

2. **Phase 2**: Agent creation
   - Implement individual agents
   - Test agent behaviors in isolation
   - Document agent capabilities

3. **Phase 3**: Integration
   - Modify CONTINUE to use agent system
   - Update command routing logic
   - Implement orchestration layer

4. **Phase 4**: Testing and optimization
   - Comprehensive testing suite
   - Performance benchmarking
   - User feedback integration

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All CONTINUE operations available through agent system
- [ ] No regression in functionality
- [ ] Improved performance metrics
- [ ] Clear documentation for agent usage
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained

## Additional Considerations

- Ensure agents follow Claude Code best practices
- Consider creating a meta-agent for orchestration
- Plan for agent versioning and updates
- Design for extensibility by third-party developers
