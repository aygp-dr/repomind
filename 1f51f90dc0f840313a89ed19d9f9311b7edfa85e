Context:
- User requested adding project name/root environment variables and tmux/Emacs development setup
- Implementation focused on Scheme/Guile development with geiser, paredit, org mode, and tramp support

Considerations:
- Added project identification variables to both .envrc and Makefile for consistency
- Created comprehensive Emacs configuration file (repomind.el) with all requested Scheme development tools
- Implemented tmux session management through Makefile targets for easy development workflow
- Ensured configuration works with Guile 3 specifically

Technical Details:
- Emacs config auto-installs required packages from MELPA if not present
- Tmux session uses project name for easy identification
- Session TTY is displayed for debugging/reference purposes
- Added proper cleanup of existing sessions before starting new ones

Issues Encountered:
- Minor permission warning from bash (non-blocking)
- No other significant issues during implementation

Timing:
- Task started: 2025-08-06
- Implementation completed in single session
- Changes tested locally with git status/diff verification
