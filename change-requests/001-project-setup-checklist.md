## Verification Steps

### Directory Structure
```bash
# Verify all directories exist
find . -type d -name "src" | head -1
find . -type d -name "specs" | head -1
find . -type d -name "tests" | head -1
find . -type d -name "experiments" | head -1
find . -type d -name "evals" | head -1
find . -type d -name "data" | head -1
find . -type d -name "docs" | head -1
```

### Makefile Functionality
```bash
# Test main Makefile
make help
make -C src help
make -C tests help
make -C experiments status
```

### File Verification
```bash
# Check key files exist
ls README.md LICENSE Makefile .gitignore
ls specs/api/*.json
ls tests/unit/*.scm
ls tests/expect/*.exp
```

## Status
- Overall Status: ✅ COMPLETE
- All directories created
- All Makefiles in place
